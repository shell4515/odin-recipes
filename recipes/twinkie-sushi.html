    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Once upon a time, I wanted to make sushi, but I had no rice, seaweed, or anything else required to make this delicious treat. What did I have on hand?
        Twinkies. Lots of twinkies and green fruit leather. Bingo, twinkie sushi was born. It was a labor of love. Everyone thought I was crazy, and I was/am. 
        I don't really have much else to say about why I would create such an abomination for human consumption.
